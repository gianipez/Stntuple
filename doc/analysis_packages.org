* How to create your own analysis package:                      

#+begin_src
pkg=$USER                                           # strongly recommended
source Stntuple/scripts/make_analysis_package $pkg  # if pkg is not specified, the created package name will be MyAna
scons lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so
#+end_src

at this point, if everything went well

- library lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so should be created

- file:../../rootlogon.C in the working directory should include the following line:    

#+begin_src
gSystem->Load("lib/lib${pkg}_ana.so");
#+end_src

- file:../../.rootrc should have the following line added:

#+begin_src
+Stnana.Package                ${pkg}
#+end_src
